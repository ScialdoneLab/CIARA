\usage{
merge_cluster(old_cluster, new_cluster, max_number = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{old_cluster}{original cluster assignment that need to be updated}

\item{new_cluster}{new cluster assignment that need to be integrated with
\emph{old_cluster}.}

\item{max_number}{Threshold in size for clusters in \emph{new_cluster}. Only
cluster with number of cells smaller than \emph{max_number} will be
integrated in \emph{old cluster}. If \emph{max_number} is NULL, then all the clusters in \emph{new_cluster} are integrated in \emph{old cluster}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length equal to \emph{old_cluster} showing the merged cluster assignment between \emph{old cluster} and \emph{new_cluster}.
